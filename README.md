## Description
Everyone wants to be fit but sometimes that just feels like an unreachable goal. The goal for this app is to make fitness and reaching goals simple. We made an easy to use app that allows the user to create routines that they can complete so that they can SIMPLY reach their goals. It also has a view history tab so that the user can look back and see all they have accomplished.
